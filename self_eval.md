- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - I could do better at note taking. I find the lesson plans provided to be helpful starts.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I lean into problem solving first, then Googling when I know I'm stuck or to see if there's a method that does something in particular that I want.
